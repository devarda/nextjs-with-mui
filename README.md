# MUI example

This example shows how to integrate MUI in Next.js using yarn and Typescript, with src/ directory.

## WHY?

- Got lazy with installing MUI and MUI icons, inputing MUI css reset and theme provider (most likely inside a client component that layout.tsx wraps) whenever I created a Next.js app
- I adopted src/ dir for organizing components, even server-side code like lambdas and wanted a quick boilerplate
- Because I wanted to see how create-next-app templates worked

## How to use

Bootstrap the example:

```bash
yarn create next-app --example https://github.com/devarda/nextjs-with-mui with-mui-app
```
